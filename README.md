# Airbnb in the Age of Hyper Customer Reviews

## Introduction

### About Airbnb
Together with Uber, the word Airbnb is synomous with the sharing economy. Airbnb is the most global online hospitality service that connects travellers with lodging from local homeowners. It is a marketplace for individuals to book or offer rooms. With services across numerous cities across the globe, Airbnb contains massive amounts of data on thousands of listings per region. There are unique listings in 81,000 cities, with over 6 million listings, in over 191 Countries.

## The Jupyter Notebook Projects

The aims of this jupyter notebook project is to analyze the latest Airbnb publicly available data from insideairbnb.com, and other sources such as public blogs (such as medium.com, airbnb.io, etc.) and news outlets (such as New York Times, and Financial Times).

This jupyter notebook project attempts to experiment and focus on the behavioural sciences of nudging and sentiment analysis. I am starting with the point of adventuring into the unknown: colliding behavioural science and data science. There could be no significant outcome; however I gut feel say there will be some (yeah, we are still human, gut feel sometimes still help, rather than base on pure data decision-making!).

This repository hosts of 4 different Jupyter Notebook Projects:

**1. JB#1 Airbnb + Natural Language Processing:** Focusing on natural language processing using NLTK and VADER.

## The Complementary Slide Decks

This repository also hosts 3 complementary slide decks:

**1. Airbnb + Sentiment Analysis:** Focusing on telling the data story from sentiment analysis perspectives.

**2. Airbnb + Predictive Modeling on Airbnb Rating System:** Focusing on telling the data story from predictive modeling perspectives.

**3. Airbnb + Hypothesis Testing on Airbnb Rating System:** Focusing on telling the data story from hypothesis testing perspectives.


## The Dataset

All Airbnb reviews and listings datsets are sourced from the Inside Airbnb website, and was scraped a few times in the month of September 2019.
